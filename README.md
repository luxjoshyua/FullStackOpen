# [Full Stack Open 2023](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

The repo is based on a course held at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/open-university/multidisciplinary-themed-modules/full-stack), in collaboration with Open University.

It introducs fullstack modern JavaScript-based web development, primarily focusing on building Single Page Applications with React that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

Specific subjects are:

- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- TypeScript
- React Native
- GitHub Actions
- Docker

The repo is a WIP that contains my solutions to the various exercises. Parts 1-9 have been completed and marked by the university. Part 10 - the react native app - can be viewed in a separate repo [over here](https://github.com/luxjoshyua/FullStackOpen-part10-react-native).
