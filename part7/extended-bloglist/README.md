To run the app, start the backend from the backend folder with `npm run dev` and the frontend with `npm start`
Note backend expects .env file with correct config to function

If wanting to run Cypress tests, run `npm run start:test` in the backend, then `npm start` in the frontend, then in a separate window, `npm run cypress:open` in the frontend
